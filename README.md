# Tech stack
Web automation end to end project uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
* [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) - is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
* [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev) - is an open source umbrella project for a range of tools and libraries aimed at supporting browser automation.
* [JUnit4](https://junit.org/junit4/) -  is an open-source framework designed to write and run repeatable automated tests.

# Prerequisites
